__poseidon__ is an open source bioinstrumentation project. The goal is to develop instruments that are readily adoptable by biology labs.

All source code, 3D model files, bill of materials, and instructions are available at the poseidon GitHub repository: [https://github.com/pachterlab/poseidon](https://github.com/pachterlab/poseidon)

## Prior work and references

As with everything in life, the Poseidon project was not developed in a vacuum. 

The pumps design was based of the open source syringe pumps published by the [Pearce Research Group](http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~pearce/Index.html):

The microscope was inspired on a design published by the [Satija Lab](http://satijalab.org/):
